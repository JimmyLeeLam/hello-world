# hello-world
My First One!
Hi GitHub Community,

My Name is Jimmy Lam and I am from Vancouver, B.C. Canada. I am a hardworking individual who loves to enjoy the many aspects of day to day life. I enjoy hockey, soccer, football, and basketball. I spend my spare time volunteering, and at the gym. I love interior design/architecture, and the environment. I also love technology and am always researching and learning about the latest tech available. If not at work or volunteering and a sizable amount of free time is available I love to travel. I have been to almost a dozen countries and eventually would like to travel to all the countries and or continents of the world if time allows.

Thank you! 

Jimmy Lam
